# RandomJava
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fishercoder1534/Leetcode.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fishercoder1534/Leetcode)
This is a Maven project containing a bunch of Random Java programs that I used, wrote from time to time.

Build instructions:
If you get compile/run/IntelliJ errors, e.g. ClassNotFoundException when running in IntelliJ, just rm your package from your local machine, use IntelliJ to directly open:
File -> New -> Project from Version Control -> GitHub, then configure JDK8, then you'll fly with colors! ^ ^
